Many IT organizations do not allow the use of Info.plist files on Mac computers, related to unapproved or non Apple notarized applications.

A sample Info-plist.txt file is provided that can be renamed if you want. This file will be located in /applications/KrankyBearTailer/Contents/MacOS/Info-plist.txt and can be simply renamed in the same location, to Info.plist

Note that MacOS LaunchPad (for as long as it still exists), and MacOS Spotlight may not index / detect / display applications with no Info.plist file, depending on some conditions.
